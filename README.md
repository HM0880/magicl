# MAGICL

_Matrix Algebra proGrams In Common Lisp_ by [Rigetti Computing](www.rigetti.com). (nÃ©e FLAIL: _Finally, Linear Algebra In Lisp!_)

Load it with `(ql:quickload :magicl)`.

## Requirements

MAGICL has only been tested with recent (> 1.3.19) SBCLs on AMD64,
though there are no internal APIs being used.

All UNIX systems require `libffi`. You can usually install this with
your package manager.

### Linux

Install both gfortran and LAPACK with your favorite package manager. All that's expected is that you have `libgfortran.so.3`, `libblas.so`, `liblapack.so`.

### macOS and OS X

On macOS, there are at least two options for using BLAS and LAPACK. The first is to use the system-provided libraries, and the second are to install them yourself.

#### Homebrew-Provided LAPACK

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager for macOS, which has LAPACK available. One can install it with:

```
brew install gfortran lapack
```

Currently, this is the assumed default for MAGICL. One can control the libraries used with the global variable `magicl::*use-brew*` set at compile time.

#### System-Provided _Accelerate_ Framework

The first are the system-optimized libraries included with macOS. These are a part of the [_Accelerate_](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate) framework. The included libraries are `libBLAS.dylib` and `libLAPACK.dylib`.

While the Accelerate framework includes these libraries, they are not a complete. We count more than 500 missing functions provided in the standard LAPACK distribution.

## Generating BLAS and LAPACK Bindings

This library takes the approach of automatically generating the bindings to BLAS and LAPACK without relying on any special tools.

In order to generate the bindings, you will need to download the Fortran 90 source files for BLAS and LAPACK. These can be found [here on netlib](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/). Once downloaded, you can re-generate the files with:

```
(ql:quickload :magicl-gen)
(in-package :magicl.generate-interface)
(generate-blapack-files #P"/path/to/lapack-3.7.1/")
```

Currently this will write to the source distribution directory of MAGICL, namely the files `blas-cffi.lisp` and `lapack-cffi.lisp`.


## History

MAGICL started as a fork of [CL-BLAPACK](https://github.com/blindglobe/cl-blapack).
